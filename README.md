# Pattern-Recognition-2022

This repository contains files from the three projects of the course Pattern Recognition of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
The course included 3 assignments: 

# Assignment 1
This project applies the **Bayes decision theory** in classification problems

In the first we are given two microbiological indicators that follow a gaussian distribution and is established that they are related to a form of cancer. Using Bayes decision theory we can find the a-posteriory probabilities.

# Assignment 2
This project uses the **Maximum Likelihood Estimator** and **Bayes Decision theory** in classification problems.

**Part A** \
In the first part we are given the distribution of an indicator x that can be used in deciding whether a patient is feeling stressed or not. 
Using maximum likelihood estimation we estimate the unknown parameters Î¸ of the distribution of x and then using a discrimination function we can create a decision rule.

**Part B** \
In this part we implement the above using Bayes Decision theory.

# Assignment 3
This project uses **Decision Trees** for data classification and **Random Dorest classifiers** using Bootstrap.

**Part A** \
In this part we use a Decision Tree Classifier to classify the species of the iris plant in three categories, Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.

**Part B** \
In this part we create a Random Forest classifier using Bootstrap.
